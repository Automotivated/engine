# Automotivated.engine()
Automotivated.engine( ) is an search api for automotive inventory. It's build with [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) and connects to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).

## Before we begin
Put on some nice [Electro Swing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUn2HvekSZY) and wait until I continue with the rest of the readme and project.

## Core concepts
The API will follow the rules of [json:api](http://jsonapi.org/)
It should return data under 150ms

## Vroom
This API is build for [Automotivated.vroom( )](https://github.com/Automotivated/vroom) and is out of the box compatible with eachother. How sweet!
